    "content": "When theaters started upgrading to stadium seating, years ago, I thought it was awesome.  I could see over other people and didn't concern myself with whether the people behind me could see.  It made for a much more enjoyable express.  Fast-forward to present, in many theaters seating is even better, as is the sound and picture quality.  The differences between theaters and quality has created a range of possible choices, beyond which movie to go see.  Instead just choosing what movie and when to see it, I have to choose 2D, 3D, IMAX, IMAX 3D, etc.  That's fine with me I usually go 3D; but now I'm supposed to select which seat in the theater I want to sit in before I can see who else is in the theather if my choice is too close or to far from the screen.  That's crazy!",
